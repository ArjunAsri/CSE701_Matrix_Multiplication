The folder containing README contains the following folders
- Assignment1_Task1
- Assignment1_Task2
- Assignment1_Task3
- Assignment1.pdf
- A top-level VHDL File containing the FSM and multipliers with the input and output
  memory interfaces exposed


- Assignment1_Task1 - This folder contains the solution to task 1 along with the testBench.

  Instructions on using TestBench

	1) Open ModelSim software
	2) Go FILE -> New -> Project. A window may prompt asking to close the current project, select continue.
	3) Then select Browse and select a folder as your working directory. Select OK.
	4) Type in the the name of your project as under Project Name category.
	5) A window will open asking to create new file or add existing files to the project. 
	6) Select add existing files to the project and then navigate to the folder where the zip file akmu999.zip file 
	   has been extracted.
	7) If the multiplier component is being tested then select "multiplier.vhd" and then "multiplier_tb.vhd" and click OK.
	8) Once all the files have been added close the window "Add items to the project".
	9) Select one of the files and then right click. Select "Compile All".
	10) Now select the Simulate tab from the task-bar on the top of the window. 
	11) Simulate -> Select folder work -> select multiplier_tb.
	12) Disable optimization by De-selecting the enable optimization tab. Click Ok.
	13) Now the software will go to simulation mode. 
	14) Select "Wave" tab at the bottom of the window if the simulation graph is not there.
	15) Select the signals needed. You can use ctrl key to select multiple signals by holding it down.
	16) Now right click and add waves to the graph.
	17) Now type "run 500 ns" in the terminal window and a waveform graph will appear.
